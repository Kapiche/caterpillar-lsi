===============
Latent Semantic Indexing plugin for Caterpillar.

Usage
-----
You can create a Latent Semantic model for an index by running the plugin:

    with IndexWriter(path) as writer:
        writer.run_plugin(LSIPlugin, num_features=300, normalise_frequencies=True)
    
...and then generate a list of similarities between all frames in an index and all frames in the model:

    with IndexReader(path) as reader:
        similarities = LSIPlugin(reader).compare_index(reader)
